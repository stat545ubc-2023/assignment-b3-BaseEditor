# Assignment B3

## Project Explanation
This repository contains code for STAT 545B's Assignments B3 and B4. This repository focuses on fulfilling the requirements of these assignments, which surround creating a shiny app. The original shinyapp allows you to investigate the relationship between penguin flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) for the palmerspenguins dataset. It contains a slider that filters by flipper length, with data visualised in a histogram, and summary statistics listed below. The new shiny app allows you to investigate relationships between penguin body mass (g) and bill length (mm) in relation to flipper length (mm), across three different species. It now includeds artwork by @allison_horst.

| Assignment B3 - app.R                 | The shiny app I created for assignment 3, focused on the dataset penguins from palmerspenguins |
| Assignment B4 - app.R                 | The shiny app I created for assignment 4, focused on the dataset penguins from palmerspenguins |

The dataset used in this app was [palmerspenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)
