# Assignment B3

## Project Explanation
This repository contains code for STAT 545B's Assignment B3. This repository focuses on fulfilling the requirements of the assignment, which surrounds creating a shiny app. This shinyapp allows you to investigate the relationship between penguin flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) for the palmerspenguins dataset. It contains a slider that filters by flipper length, with data visualised in a histogram, and summary statistics listed below.
